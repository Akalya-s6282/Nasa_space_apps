ImpactScope

Tagline: Turning geospatial data into actionable insights for smarter decisions.


---

Overview

ImpactScope is a data-driven platform designed to process and analyze geospatial elevation and environmental datasets, enabling organizations to make informed decisions quickly. By integrating high-resolution data with intuitive visualization, we empower users to identify patterns, risks, and opportunities in their areas of interest.

Our goal is to simplify complex spatial data analysis, transforming raw information into actionable insights for urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

Key Features

High-Resolution Elevation Analysis: Quickly process DEM and LiDAR datasets to generate accurate terrain models.

Interactive Visualization: Visualize large geospatial datasets in an intuitive dashboard.

Impact Assessment Tools: Identify flood-prone areas, optimal infrastructure locations, and risk zones.

Data Integration: Seamlessly combine multiple data sources for holistic analysis.

How It Works

1. Data Input: Upload elevation or geospatial datasets (e.g., .tif, .csv).


2. Processing Engine: Advanced algorithms clean, analyze, and generate terrain metrics.


3. Visualization & Reporting: Interactive maps, heatmaps, and reports for decision-making.



Tech Stack:

Backend: Python, Flask/FastAPI

Frontend: Flet / Streamlit (for interactive dashboards)

Data Processing: GDAL, NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Leaflet.js
